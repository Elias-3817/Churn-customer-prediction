    "- **Fiber-optic customers** who stay often hover around 45–50 months—so they generally stick around longer. Even so, most churners here still leave within the first 6–8 months. A few do linger before leaving, probably because fiber is pricier or they’re on contracts, but churn almost always happens early.\n",
    "- **No-Internet customers** have a median tenure near 25–30 months if they don’t churn (so they’re less “sticky” than internet users overall), but churners in this group drop out almost immediately (sub-3 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**  \n",
    "No matter if it’s DSL, fiber, or no internet, **short tenure = high churn risk**. Retention work needs to zero in on that first year—especially months 0–6—because that’s when the vast majority of churn happens.\n"
